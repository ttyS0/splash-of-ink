The lights on the clock read 11:00 AM. With a groan Timothy rolled out of bed. The morning routine flowed from him like a spring unwinding within a clock. His body seemed to be not much more than the gears of the clock, moving through pre ordained tasks.

Start the coffee.

Take a shower.

Get dressed.

Brush teeth.

Open the curtains.

Pour coffee.

Checking his watch, it was now 11:15 AM. He had shaved another minute from the morning routine. Long ago he had tried not to bother with it at all, but that had lead to unforeseen complications. Some events seemed to be required. Putting his coffee cup down, Timothy bolted out the door.

Glancing at his watch, he saw the second hand spin towards 12:00 PM. "Damn it!" he yelled. Stopping in the middle of the street, Timothy watched the second hand sweep the dial. 11:58, 11:59....

The lights on the clock read 11:00 AM.

Timothy wasn't sure how many lifetimes he had spent in the hour between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM, but it felt like all of them. He couldn't remember why he thought it was important to get to the train station before time reset itself, but it had become his only goal. He had to try and shave off five minutes. That might be enough.

11:09 AM. Timothy put down his coffee cup, and raced out his door, hoping it would be the last time.
