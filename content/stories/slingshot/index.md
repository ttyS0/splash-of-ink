Sweat glistened on their faces as the odor of melting plastic permeated the control room as the ship approached the sun. Alice's hand rested on a metal lever, her thumb rubbing over faint ridges of rust.

Marcie leaned over Alice's shoulder, and they both stared. Fingers tapping at the ship's console, Alice let out a calming sigh. 

"No signs of space junk, Marcie. We made it!"
