Stumbling from the pub, Fredrick turned down an alley. 

Beside a dumpster bright lights erupted. Dazed, he stared at a fortune teller machine, like the ones at carnivals. With a stumble, he stepped closer.

The mannequin smiled at him with green jeweled eyes. Looking down, he swayed as the credits dial moved on its own, clicking from zero to one. With drunken aplomb, he pressed the fortune button.

Frederick was now staring at himself. He watched as his body looked at his own hands. Then patted and felt all over his clothes. Jeweled green eyes looked back from his own face. Frozen, he watched as his body exited the alley.
