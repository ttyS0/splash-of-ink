Spinning in circles, she gazed at the cracked plaster ceiling as tendrils of dust grabbed at her ankles like hungry ghosts.

James stepped into the room, looked around, and called her name. Screaming, Lucy pounded on the glass as he turned and left. Silence fell as a hot breath pressed against the nape of her neck.
