A fuzzy brown animal digs a shallow hole, and drops an acorn in. It covers it, and scurries away.

Tiny fragile leaves push up from the dirt, and taste at the first rays of sunshine.

Competition for sunlight is less now that the strange upright animals removed so many other trees. 

The animals zoom about, laying stones around the tree in a large square. They dig many animal sized holes.

Ornate boxes are put in the holes. The animals leave. Moss covers the stones.

The tree watches a fuzzy grey animal dig a shallow hole, and drop an acorn in.
