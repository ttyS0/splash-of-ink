"Don't be absurd. I'm sure there's a very ordinary explanation. Now, run along, it's almost bedtime."

The boy huffed, and stormed from the room. The old man smiled, watching him go. The basement door slammed a few seconds later. With a soft breeze, a tall statuesque woman appeared. 

"What was that all about?" she asked.

"Some silliness about the new neighbors." 

The woman got a faraway look, and glanced at a wall as if she were looking right through it to the house next door. "I don't know," she mumbled.

"Come on. You don't really believe that they could be..."

The woman's sharp glance silenced the old man. He rolled his eyes, and got up from his chair. Gliding to a window, he pulled aside the heavy drapes. There were no lights on in the new neighbor's house, and it was almost dawn.

"You really think they might be humans?"
