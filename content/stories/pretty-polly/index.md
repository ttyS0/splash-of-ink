Visiting the retired Commander always made Williams uneasy. His place was a little too musty and dim for his liking.

"Drink?" the Commander asked.

"Not tonight." 

Williams wandered about the room, absently touching littered trinkets. Feeling like he was in a museum, he stopped at the parrot cage.

"Any leads?" 

"Just an odd phrase. It's probably nothing." 

Without warning the parrot squawked, "Pretty Polly", and whistled. 

Williams spun. The Commander smiled, aiming a pistol.
