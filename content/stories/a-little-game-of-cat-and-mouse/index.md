"CHARGE!"

Their cry echoed through the air as Phillip and Charles, wielding tiny plastic forks, sailed through the air. The mice landed with a bounce and rolled to upright positions. 

The tabby cat purred seductively, and stared at the tiny warriors. 

"En garde!" Yelled Phillip, stabbing at the cat's paw. 

The plastic tines snapped right off!

With a liquid motion the cat darted to the left, and circled. Charles spun to see Phillip's tail disappear into the mouth of the cat. 

Dropping his plastic weapon, Charles fled as fast his little legs could carry him, squeaking, "Never again! Never again!"
