The University was quiet, most students having left for summer break. Stephanie, perched in her favorite tree, watched a line of students exit the greenhouse. They could have been marching, except for their shambling gait. 

Sliding from the tree, she crept to the greenhouse's entrance. Peaking inside she saw Professor Musk with a student.

He walked around to behind the student. 

"...the infected are often described as zombie ants."

Fine tendrils spun out from his neck, and stabbed into the face of the unwary student. Musk looked up, locking his eyes with Stephanie's. She turned to find herself surrounded by slack jawed students. 

Smashing an empty clay pot over the head of the nearest, she ran.
