Jerry's eyes popped open to a dark bedroom. Rolling over, red numbers hovered in the distance, reading 2:24 AM. He had been waking up around the same time the past few nights. With a heavy sigh, Jerry readjusted the covers, and tried to go back to sleep. This night, just before drifting back into slumber, he heard a knock. It was followed by a rapid succession of two, three, no four knocks.

2:38 AM

Now angry, Jerry launched from the bed. Flicking on the bathroom light he saw three thick tentacles swiping at the walls. They terminated at the toilet, now shattered.
